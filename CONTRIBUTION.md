# Contributing

Thanks for interest in contributing! The best way to contribute to this project is actually to try and set it up yourself. 
Follow the instructions on [README.md](README.md), and be sure to report any bugs that you come across!

## Bug Reports/Feature Request

First check the **Issues** tab if this bug/feature has already been reported. If not, just add a new issue and follow the existing template.

## Code Contribution

The current code base is quite unorganized, so check out [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) for basic documentation on the code.

Our pull request system is standard:
1. Fork the repository and make your changes, either on main or an aptly named branch like `feature/new-feature` or `bug/oh-no`.
2. Make your changes.
3. Create a pull request to the `main` branch of the base repository.
4. Once the PR is reviewed and all the fixes are made, the PR will be merged!
